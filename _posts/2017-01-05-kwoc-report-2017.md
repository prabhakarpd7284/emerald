## About KWoC

[Kharagpur Winter Of Code](kwoc.kossiitkgp.in) is a 5-week long online program to introduce open source software development to students. It is open for all students from various colleges.

It provides a glimpse of what contributing to an open source project means. It is kind of ground work for Google Summer Of Code. For students who want to participate in Google Summer Of Code, but confused about its procedures and have doubts, KWoC is a good opportunity for them.

## Choosing the Project

This is a very important step and we have to choose projects carefully. The list of projects was available on [kwoc.kossiitkgp.in/projects](kwoc.kossiitkgp.in/projects) with their details and mentors' name.  I went through all projects and came to select 3-4 projects. By going through each of these projects in more detail, I finally decided to contribute on the project -[notes_app](https://github.com/ankita132/notes_app) whose mentor was [Ankita Sahoo](https://github.com/ankita132). I mailed her and told I wanted to work on this. She told me a few things to start from.

## Progress

### Learning version control system

I had used github before but had very little experience with git. My mentor [Ankita Sahoo](https://github.com/ankita132) suggested that I should learn git. So, I did a tutorial on git and github on [Udacity](https://in.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775). I dedicated some time in learning git commands.

### 1st PR

The issue was to add notes without leaving the page. I searched the Internet and was able to write a snippet of code which did the above job. Along with the functionality of adding notes asynchronously, I also added functionality for editing and deleting notes asynchronously by using Ajax. I also corrected one bug in this PR. This PR got merged without any issue. I was very happy after it got merged.

![PR1](/emerald/img/pr1.png "First Pull Request")

This boosted my confidence and then I started working on other issues. I created another PR, then another one and this process went till last week of December.

### 2nd PR

In this PR, I made searching of notes asynchronously. Search results were displayed on same page without reloading. I also removed some redundant files.

### 3rd PR

This issue was a little challenging for me. The task was to change profile image of an user. There were many important steps in this implementation.

- **_Verify that the file uploaded is an image and well within standard size limit of default value that a mongoDB(database) offer_**.

- **_Name of the uploaded image that will be saved on server_**

If uploaded image has same name as any file on server, it replaces that file on server. At this point, our project had e-mail of an user set as its primary identity, so it was possible that 2 users can have same username. After a lot of searching and thinking, I came with a solution. Image name of a user was ``username + current_time``. Thus, even if any 2 users have same username, still updating one's profile image will not replace other's profile image.

![PR3](/emerald/img/pr3.png "Pull Request 3")

There were some bugs after creating PR, that I managed to fix quickly. It also got merged after a lot of discussion with my mentor. She
pointed my mistakes and I did the work to rectify them. Finally, this PR also got merged.

### 4th PR

This issue was aimed at making the app more user-friendly. We had to categorize notes into different genres. I also added option of sorting by genre where the notes of the user were displayed.

![PR4](/emerald/img/pr4.png "Pull Request 4")

### 5th PR

I had reported this issue. I had encountered this issue while working on #3 Image name.

![PR5](/emerald/img/pr5.png "Pull Request 5")

**Finally, app looked like this**.

## Conclusion

Thus, my little journey came to an end. But I think this is my new start towards open source software development. Huge Thanks to my mentor Ankita Sahoo for supporting me throughout these weeks. I would also like to thanks KWoC for providing this platform to students like me. I have learned a lot of things doing this project and also experienced to work in collaboration with other contributors.
